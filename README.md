# OttoMap

OttoMap is a tool that translates TribeNet turn report files into JSON data.

A future version of the tool will convert the JSON data into a map.

## Overview
I'm planning on translating a small subset of the turn report.
See the files in the `domain` directory to get an idea of what we're looking at.

I think that will be enough data to feed the map generator.
Let me know if you think that there's something missing.
